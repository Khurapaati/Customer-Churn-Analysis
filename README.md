# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard Using PowerBi
### This Git report aims to analyze the factors contributing to customer churn within our company, with a focus on the impact of unresolved customer tickets and the shift of contract customers to month-to-month plans, particularly among younger demographics.


## Problem Statement
Our company faces a significant challenge with customer churn. On average, 1,869 customers out of a total of 7,043 have churned. The issue is exacerbated when customer tickets remain unresolved. Younger demographics, in particular, tend to leave if their concerns are not addressed promptly. Additionally, there has been a noticeable loss in revenue due to contract customers shifting to month-to-month plans.
